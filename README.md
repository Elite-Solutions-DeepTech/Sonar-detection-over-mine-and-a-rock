# Sonar-detection-over-mine-and-a-rock

### Abstract:
- Sonar (sound navigation and ranging or sonic navigation and ranging)is a technique that uses sound propagation (usually underwater, as in submarine navigation) to navigate, measure distances (ranging), communicate with or detect objects on or under the surface of the water.

- Sonar detection technology plays a crucial role in distinguishing between mines and rocks underwater. The primary objective is to enhance the accuracy and reliability of sonar systems in identifying potential threats such as naval mines, while minimizing false positives from harmless rocks. This abstract reviews the principles of sonar operation, including the emission and reflection of sound waves, and the interpretation of the resulting echo patterns. Key factors influencing detection capabilities are discussed, such as the material composition, shape, and size of both mines and rocks, as well as the environmental conditions like water temperature, salinity, and depth.

- Advanced signal processing techniques, including machine learning algorithms and pattern recognition, are highlighted for their potential to improve differentiation between these objects. Recent advancements in sonar technology.
